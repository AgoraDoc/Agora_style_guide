### Common issues when native-Chinese speakers write English content //TODO William I am tempted to move this to its own chapter (and perhaps expand it if necessary) since it doesn't fit with the two reference tables here (three if you put Product names back here, which I hope you agree is best).

The worldwide language of programming is English, so it is essential for our writing to sound like a native English speaker wrote it.

The following are some issues that native Chinese speakers sometimes encounter when writing English content and how to overcome them:

#### Omitting or inserting articles

In Chinese, there is no need for articles ("a," "an," and "the") before nouns, so Chinese speakers often forget to add the appropriate article in English. In some cases, Chinese speakers overcompensate and add an article when it is not needed. While there is no foolproof way to solve this problem, try speaking the English phrase out loud. If it sounds odd to you, it probably is. When in doubt, talk to a colleague, or reach out to a native English speaker. See [](language-and-grammar.md#articles-a-an-the).

#### Gender confusion

Chinese does not have separate gender pronouns (such as "he" and "she", "his" and "her"). In most technical writing, however, you should avoid referring to a specific gender. When necessary, use the gender non-specific "they" instead. See [](language-and-grammar.md#second-person).

#### Singular and plural nouns and uncountable nouns

In Chinese, context distinguishes between singular and plural nouns. In English, plural nouns often end with an "s" (for example: singular "method," plural "methods"). But this is not the case for all English nouns, such as the "uncountable nouns," which are things that cannot be counted by numbers. Examples include "information," "equipment," "knowledge," "research," "safety," and "evidence." These words are already effectively plural, so they need no *s* at the end. See [](language-and-grammar.md#articles-a-an-the).

#### Verb-tense confusion

There is no such thing as verb conjugation to denote past, present, or future tenses in Chinese, as context provides the necessary cues. Write using the active voice and present tense in English to minimize any difficulty in using other tenses. See [](language-and-grammar.md#active-voice) and [](language-and-grammar.md#present-tense).
